# Road to Mastery development blog

This is just a practice project to learn more about the Remix framework, Tailwind CSS and Sanity.io

I may publish technical aricles on it from time to time. :)

## Installation

- `app/`: the Remix application codebase, just follow the readme in it
- `studio/`: the Sanity.io studio codebase, `sanity start` for local development, `sanity deploy` to deploy the modification
